# Count how many lines there are in each file

find *.fasta -exec wc -l {} + 

# The answer goes:
#     27 407228326.fasta
#    127 407228412.fasta
#  78104 E.coli.fasta
#  78258 total

# Print everything starting from the second line for the E. Coli genome

tail -n 78103 E.coli.fasta


###########
# Count the sequence length of this genome

tail -n 78103 E.coli.fasta > E.coli.genome.txt | wc -m E.coli.genome.txt 

### tail -n 78103 E.coli.fasta > E.coli.genome.txt ###
# This first part creates a .txt file that contains only the genome sequence 
### wc -m E.coli.genome.txt ###
# The second part then counts the number of characters (wc -m) in that new file
#
# The answer is:
# wc -m E.coli.genome.txt 


############
# Count the matches of a particular sequence, “ATGC” in the genome of E. coli (hint: Start by removing the first line and removing newline characters)

grep -o ATGC E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l

# The answer is:
# 20853
#
# Here I modified the command so it counts the number of mathcing ELEMENTS and not LINES...

#Compute the AT/GC ratio. That is, the (A+T)/(G+C) ratio (as a single number). This is a summary measure of base composition of double-stranded DNA. DNA from different organisms and lineages has different ratios of the A-to-T and G-to-C base pairs (google “Chargaff’s rule”). For example, DNA from organisms that live in hot springs have a higher GC content, the GC base pair is more thermally stable.

a=$(grep -o A E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l); t=$(grep -o T E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l); c=$(grep -o C E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l); g=$(grep -o G E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l); at=$((a + t)); cg=$((c + g)); echo "A count: $a"; echo "T count: $t"; echo "C count: $c"; echo "G count: $g"; echo "AT total: $at"; echo "CG total: $cg"; echo "AT/CG ratio: $(echo "scale=4; $at / $cg" | bc)"

# I have to admit that I asked COpilot on that one. My initial guess was : 
# a=$(grep -o A E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l) | t=$(grep -o T E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l) | c=$(grep -o C E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l) | g=$(grep -o G E.coli.genome.txt | wc -l) | at=$($a + $t) ; cg=$($c + $g) | expr $at / $cg
# Where the syntax for arithmetic operation was poorly chosen.
